Follow allsteps:

Install the latest protobuf version (in my case is 4.21.1)
pip install --upgrade protobuf

Copy builder.py from .../Lib/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal to another folder on your computer (let's say 'Documents')
Install a protobuf version that is compatible with your project (for me 3.19.6)
pip install protobuf==3.19.6

Copy builder.py from (let's say 'Documents') to Lib/site-packages/google/protobuf/internal
